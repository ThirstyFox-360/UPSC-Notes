## Pre-Historic India
- Robert Bruce: discovered first palaeolithic tool-Pallavaram Axe
	- later he discovered large number of pre-historic sites in S India
- Sir Mortimer Wheeler equally significant
- divided in 4 part

----

#### Palaeolithic Age
- Greek word 'palaeo' > old and 'lithic' > stone
- from 500,000 to 10,000 BCE
- developed in the Pleinstocene Age (Ice Age)
- belonged to Homo Sapiens
- did not have a complex language
	- used basic sign language
- in India belonged to Negrito Race
- lived in open air, river valleys, caves
- hunters and gatherers
- no knowledge of agriculture, house building, pottery and any metal
- evidence of art in the form of paintings in upper palaeolithic age

Tools:
- used unpolished, undressed rough stones
- stone tools were made of a hard rock 'quartzite'
	- That's why called 'Quartzite men' (in India)
- Early or Lower Palaeolithc age
	- hand axes, choppers, cleavers
- Middle Palaeolithic
	- stone tools made of flakes
	- scrapers, borers, points, blades
- Later or Upper Palaeolithic
	- parallel sided blades, burins
	- some instances of stone tools

- Homo Sapiens first appeared in the end of Upper Palaeolithic age

----

#### Mesolithic Age
- Greek word 'meso' > middle
- belonged to the Holocene era
- key aspect of this age was reduction in the size of tools
- Microliths: miniature stone tools
	- made of crypto-crystalline silica, chalcedony or cert
- used wooden or bone handles
- lived in semi-permanent settlements 
- buried dead with grave goods (believed in life after death)
- initiated rock art
- 1857: first rock painting discovered at Sohagigat (Kaimur hills, UP)
- animals dominated the scenes (no snakes)
- division of labour on the basis of gender

Some IMP sites:

Site|Importance
----|----
Bagor (RJ) on R.Kothari|largest and best documented 
Mahadaha (UP) | - bone artefacts, arrow heads, bone ornaments -burial of man and woman together
Adamgarh (MP) | earliest evidence of domestication of animals
Langhnaj , Mehsana (GJ), Kaimur region of Mirza | pottery found

----

#### Neolithic Age
- Greek word 'Neo' > new
- in northern India from 8000-6000 BCE
	- in southern and eastern as late as 1000 BCE
- V Gordon Childe termed as =='Neolithic Revolution'==
- food producing stage
- sharp and polished tools
- cultivated fruits and corns like raagi, horse gram (kulathi)
- domesticating cattle, sheep, goats
	- emergence of settled agricultural communities
- bone tools such as needles, scrapers, borers, arrowheads, pendants, bangles, earrings
- first made pottery by hand and then by potter's wheel
	- included black barnished ware, grey ware,  mat-impressed ware
- lived in circular and rectangular house made of mud and reed
- knew how to make boats and could spin cotton, wool and weave cloth

Regional Cultures: 

Site | Culture
----|----
NW India | began at 7000 BCE in Mehargarh; preceded in IVC
Kashmir | contemporary to Harappan civilisation; lived in pit house (4 M depth, to escape cold)
Ganga valley and C India | characterised by cord marked pottery
S India | mainly in AP, Karnataka and NW Tamil Nadu; ash mounds in centre with settlements around them
NE India | arrived at 2500-1500 BCE or even late

----

#### Chalcolithic Age
- from 3000-500 BCE
- aka Copper-Stone Age
- emergence of the use of metal along stone tools
- first metal to be used ==Copper and Bronze==
- largely applies to settlements of pre-Harappans
- subsisted on agriculture and cattle rearing 
- produced wheat and rice as their staple, bajra, several pulses such as lentil, black gram, green gram and grass pea 
- in eastern region fish and rice
- practiced slash-burn (jhum) cultivation
- neither the plough nor the hoe has been found 
- domesticated cows, sheep, goats, pigs and buffaloes (no horses)
- cooked food and ate beef too
- pottery using potter's wheel (only male used wheel)
- painted with white line designs
- black and red pottery and ochre coloured pottery (OCP)
- rural settlements; trenched houses made of mud bricks (didn't used burnt bricks)
- Chief lived in rectangular house whereas others in round huts (beginning of social inequalities)
- small clay images of earth goddesses 
- Mother Goddess
- bull terracotta (probably the symbol of their religion or village) (Malwa and RJ)
- people were fond of ornaments and decorations 
- women wore ornaments of shell and bone and carried combs in their hairs
- manufactured beads of semi-precious stones such as carnelian, steatite and quartz crystal
- expert coppersmith; knew the art of copper smelting and good stone workers as well, knew spinning and weaving (didn't knew writing)
- Infant mortality was very high (burial of large number of children in W MH)

Chalcolithic Cultures | Key Sites
----|----
Banas Culture (SE RJ) (2600-1900 BCE) | Ahar near Udaipur and Gilund
