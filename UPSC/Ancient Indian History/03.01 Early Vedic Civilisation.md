- literal meaning > 'end of the Vedas'
- reveal the final aim of the vedas
- condemn sacrifice and ceremony


#### Vedanga
- means 'the limbs of the Vedas'
- the supplementary texts that aid in
- these do not qualify as Shruti as they are considered of human origin (not revealed by the gods) and are written in the form of ==Sutras==
- Sutras are very short condensed statements that are used to express varied ideas

#### Puranas
- literally means 'old'
- the religious sectarian literature of later times (around 4th 6th centuries), but have a well-defined perception of the past traditions
- reflect the Brahmanical social and religious values and also shed light on the emergence and development of Hindu religious practices
- discuss five topics in the time span of four ages/yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali)
	- ==Sarga== (Deals with the creation of the world) 
	- ==Pratisarga== (Recreation) 
	- ==Manvantaras== (Periods of the various Manus) 
	- ==Vamsha== (Genealogies of the gods and rishis) 
	- ==Vamshanucharita== (Texts relating to royal dynasties, both the Suryavanshis—who claimed their descent from the Sun—and Chandravanshis—who claimed their descent from the Moon)
- considered to be composed by ==Vyasa==
- the four yugas make up a mahayuga, that 1000 mahayugas make a kalpa, that and every kalpa is further divided into 14 manvantaras which are presided over by a specific Manu
- Each Yuga is periodically destroyed and again, the recreation of world occurs with the cyclical decline and revival of Dharma
- The Puranas are further divided into ==18 Mahapuranas== (great Puranas such as ==Brahma, Vishnu, Narada, Bhagavata, Padma, Garuda, Varaha, Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Shiva, Skanda, Agni, Vamana,== etc.)

#### Dharmashastra
- the Sanskrit texts dealing specifically with ==Dharma (code of conduct)==
- Dharma also refers to the fulfillment of ==Purusharthas== (life goals) such as Dharma (righteous conduct), Artha (material well-being), Kama (sensual pleasure), and Moksha (liberation from the cycle of life and death)
- Dharmashastras are further subdivided into ==Dharmasutras== (composed during c.600 300 BCE) and ==Smritis== (composed during c.200 BCE 900 CE)
- three sources of Dharma, namely, the Vedas (Shruti), Smriti (that which is remembered) texts, and Shistachara (good mannerisms and practices of decent cultured people)
- Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas were considered ==Dvija (twice born)==
- The four ashrams dividing the life of a **dvija male** were:
	- ==Brahmacharya (Celibate studenthood)==
	- ==Grihastha (Household caretaker)==
	- ==Vanaprastha (Partial renunciation)== 
	- ==Sanyasa (Complete renunciation)==

#### Epics
- link between the Puranas and the epics is that the heroes and clans who are the actors in the epics are the descendants of ==Manu’s progeny==
- two Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are part of both oral and written traditional history
- The two epics were clearly aware of each other as the Mahabharata has a section called ==Ramopakhyana==, detailing the story of Rama, and the Ramayana mentions ==the Kurus and, Hastinapurv but does not mention the Mahabharata war

Mahabharata | Ramayana
----|----
Roughly composed between c. 400 BCE−400CE | Roughly composed between c. 400 BCE−300CE
composed by Ved Vyasa and consists of 18 Parvas (books) and has around 1 lakh verses; considerably longer than Ramayana | Ramayana is considered as the Adi-Kavya (first conscious poetry) composed by Valmiki and it consists of seven Kandas (books) having around 24,000 verses
Traditionally, the war is believed to have happened in the Dvapara yuga. But, historians consider the events and social character of the Mahabharata corresponding to an earlier stage of development than the Ramayana, as the Mahabharata setting pertains to the Indo-Gangetic divide and upper Ganga valley | Traditionally, it is considered that Rama lived in the Treta yuga, i.e., earlier than the Mahabharata. But, since the setting of Ramayana shifted eastwards to the middle Ganga Valley, and the language of the Ramayana is more polished and its concepts more closely related to later societies, historians consider it of a later stage than the Mahabharata

### Political Life
- tribal society
- people lived in semi-nomadic life
- Aryan tribes were called *Janas*
- their cheif (Rajan) was known as *Gopati* or *Gopa* (protector of cows); chief queen was known as *Mahisi*
- *Panis*: enemies of *Janas*; used to hide cattles of Aryans in the forest and often had conflicts
- In order to get their cattle back, the Vedic God ‘Indra’ was invoked and many battles known as Gavisthi, Gaveshana, Goshu, or Gavyat (to search for cows) were fought between the Aryans and the Panis
- the Gopati’s office was not hereditary and he was selected among the clan’s men and was perhaps elected by the assembly called *Samiti*
- tribal assemblies
	- ==Sabha==: smaller body meant for elites
	- ==Samiti==: broad- based for folk assembly, presided over by Rajan
	- ==Vidatha==: tribal assembly with diverse functions
	- ==Gana==: assembly or troop
- imp functionaries of Rig Vedic societies
	- ==Purohit== (Priest): assisted and advised the chief on various matters; in exchange of their ritualistic services they recieved *dana* and *dakshina*
	- ==Senani== (Chief of Army)
	- ==Gramini== (Leader of village and fighting unit)
	- ==Vrajapati== (officer who controlled the territory)
- no mention of any officer for administering justice
- no evidence of tax collecting officer
- people offered to the cheif a voluntary contribution called *bali*
- militaristic society
- The Rig Vedic charioteers used ==Varma== (Coats of mail) and ==sipra/sironastra== (helmets) and went to combat equipped with ==asi== (sword), ==hanas== (arrows) and ==ilhianus== (bows)
- no permanent army, mobilised at the time of war
- two types of battles:
	- with pre-Aryans (probably reffered to them as Dasas/ Dasyus)
	- Amongst themselves
		- a battle occured between a Bharata king Divodasa (winner) and Dasa ruler Shambara
		- ==Dashrajan War==: fought between the Bharata cheif ==Sudas==(winner, grandson of Divodasa on one side and ten tribes (Yadu, Turvasha, Puru, Anu and Druhyu...); on the banks of river ==Paurushni (Ravi)==; Later the Bharatas joined hands with the ==Purus== to form ==the Kuru== tribe who further allied with the ==Panchals== and established their control over the Upper Ganga Valley
