### Harappan Civilisation (2600-1900 BCE)

- also known as Bronze age
- first urban civilisation in S Asia
- contemporaneous with Mesopotamian and Egypt
- major settlements are located in the Ghaggar-Hakra belt
- Harappa, as the first archaeological site to be discovered, therefore gives its name to the entire civilisation
- It forms a part of the proto-history of India, and belongs to the Bronze Age 
- While it is classified as a civilisation that is older than Chalcolithic civilisations, in many ways it was far more developed than settlements in the Chalcolithic Age

#### Early/ Pre-Harappan phase (3200-2600 BCE)
- aka Regionalisation Era
- formative, proto-urban phase of civilisation
- related to the Hakra phase of settlements
- settlements were fortified, fairly high level of expertise in specialised crafts such as stone working, bead making, and metal crafting
- the use of wheeled transport and the existence of trade networks
- didn't have the large cities
- Some of the early Harappan archaeological sites are Padri in Gujarat, Kalibangan in Rajasthan, Dholavira in Kutch, Harappa in West Punjab, Balakot, Amri, and Bhirrana in Haryana, Kot Diji and Gumla (no early Harappan sites in the active Indus plain)

#### Mature Harappan phase (2600-1900 BCE)
- aka Integration Era
- the urban phase of the civilisation
- most sites have the same basic set of Harappan material traits, such as the typical red and black pottery, terracotta figurines, standardised brick size in 1:2:4 ratio
- Some of the imp sites: Harappa (W Punjab), Mohenjo-Daro and Suktagendor (PK), Lothal, Kalibangan (RJ), Dholavira, Banawali and Rakhighari (HR)

#### Late Harappan Phase (1900-1300 BCE)
- aka Localisation Era
- post-urban phase, defined by decline in the cities
- refers to the fragmentation of the culture of the Integration Era
- settlements were smaller compared to MHP
- gradual change in seals, pottery confined writing, in the frequency of cubical weights, 
- comprises of 5 geographical zones each having distinct phases:
	- The West Punjab: Cemetery-Harappan Culture
	- The East Punjab Phase
	- The Jhukar Phase: Jhukar, Chanhudaro, Amri
	- The Rangpur Phase: Kutch, Saurashtra and mainland GJ
	- The Ganga-Yamuna Doab Phase: settlements more in number but smaller and more rural, marked by a diverse agricultural base

### General Features of the Mature Harappan Phase
- emerged from pre Harappan/ indigenous village culture (or it owes its origin to the Mesopotamian Civilisation)  
- triangular in shape and largest amongst the two 
- Borders:
	- N: Manda (JK)
	- E: Alamgirpur (UP)
	- S: Malvan (GJ)
	- W: Suktagendor (Baluchistan)

#### Town Planning
- famous for its urban outlook
- divided in two parts
	- Citadel/ Raised Part: 
		- smaller than Lower part
		- mostly to the West of the city
		- Rulers and elites lived here
		- contained public buildings, granaries and important buildings
	- Lower Part:
		- common citizenry lived here

- main street being 10 m wide
- divided town into rectangular and square blocks
- lamp-posts at intervals
- Burnt bricks of identical ratio of 1:2:4 (t:w:l) used across all Harappan structures
- average size of bricks 7×14×28 cm for houses and 10×20×40 cm for city walls
- excellent drainage system, made of mortar, lime and gypsum and covered with large brick slabs for easy cleaning
- houses were of two or more storeys, had tiled bathrooms, some house had their own wells but no window faced the street

#### Society
- urban society
- mostly of middle class
- three distinct social groups: rulers, rich merchants and poor laborers
- professions such as priests, warriors, peasants, traders and artisans
- different types of buildings were used as residence by different classes
- society appears to be matriarchal in nature as indicated by the finding of a large numbers of terracotta female figurines and also based on the popularity of the mother goddess
- men are mostly shown wearing a dress wrapped round the lower half of the body with one end worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm
- wore garments of cotton, silk and wool
- a piece of woven cloth has been found at Mohenjo-Daro while discovery of spindles and needles at many sites attest to the practice of spinning and weaving among the Harappan people

#### Agriculture and Animal Domestication
- grew wheat (especially in Mehrgarh), barley, horse gram, peas, melon, watermelon, sesame, dates, millets, grapes, henna, garlic, mustard, rice (Lothal)
- ploughed fields with the help of wooden plough (discovered at Kalibangan)

- earliest known civilisation to produce cotton
- cotton was known as *Sindon* by the Greeks as it was from Sindh
- domesticated cattles (oxen, buffaloes, goats, humped bulls, sheep, pigs, asses, camels)
- cats and dogs were also domesticated (no horse)
- well acquainted with elephants and rhinoceros

#### Industries and Crafts
- bead and ornament making, shell bangle making, ivory carving and metal working 
- refined the art of bead making and made beads and ornaments out of shell, carnelian, jasper, crystal, steatite and metal like copper, bronze, gold and terracotta 
- Bead makers' shop have been excavated at Chanhudaro and Lothal
- at Allahdino (Karachi) a lot of necklaces made of gold and silver, carnelian and semi-precious stones have been found
- good at metallurgy and producing alloys
- stone sculpture of a bearded men (more in AnC)

#### Pottery
- Primarily red black pottery (red ware pottery painted with black designs, usually that of trees and circles) was popular
- horizontal lines of varied thickness, leaf patterns, palm and pipal trees, intersecting circles, geometrical motifs with both floral faunal patterns such as figurines of birds, fishes, and animals like rabbits, peacocks, ducks, pigeons, wild fowl and monkeys
- shaped like dish-on-stands, S-shaped jars, plates, dishes, bowls, pots 
- used for storing grain, water, brewing fermented alcoholic beverages

#### Distinguishing Features of Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations

Harappan | Mesopotamian
---|---
Planned towns with chess board system, excellent drainage system | Towns show a haphazard growth
Rectangular houses with brick-lined bathrooms and wells together with their stairways are found in all Harappan cities | Such town planning absent
Produced their own characteristic pottery and seals | No such unique aspect
Invented their own typical script, which bears no resemblance to the Egyptian and Mesopotamian scripts | Mesopotamia has cuneiform script and the Egyptian script is known as hieroglyphics. Both scripts have been deciphered, which tell us a lot about the civilisations
Script mostly on seals | Mesopotamians pressed letters onto moist clay tablets while Egyptians wrote on papyrus sheets made of reeds
No signs of existence after 1900 BCE | Continued to exist even after 1900 BCE
Spread over awider area | Less area as compared to Harappa

#### Late Harappan Phase (1900-1300 BCE)
- decline of urban life
- diversification of agriculture
- some urban centres surviving in this period were Kudwala in Cholistan, Bet Dwarka in Gujarat and Daimabad
- beginnig of double cropping (wheat and barley- winter crops; rice, milltes and sorghum- summer crops)
- also refer to as sub-Indus culture
- chalcolithic in nature
- painted Harappan pottery is replaced with less intricate designs and painted grey ware (PGW)
- pots were thicker and sturdier and many peculiar Harappan shapes like perforated jars, s-shaped jars disappeared
- No object for measuring length is noticed
- the end of the Harappan trade with West Asian centres
- Important places pertaining to this phase are Prabhas Patan (Somnath), Rangpur (Gujarat), Swat Valley, Manda in Jammu, Sanghol in Punjab, Daulatpur in Haryana, Alamgirpur, Hulas in UP

#### Latest Updates
- Scientists from IIT-Kharagpur and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have uncovered evidence that the Indus Valley Civilisation is at least 8,000 years old
- the researchers have found evidence of a pre-Harappan civilisation that existed for at least 1,000 years before Egyptian (7000-3000 BCE) and Mesopotamian (6500-3100 BCE)
- Burnt Bricks: Harappa 
- Dried Bricks: Egypt 
- Baked Bricks: Mesopotamia/Sumeria
- At the time of the Harappan civilisation, Sindh and Rajasthan were not desert areas as they are today
- The Harappans knew the use of wheel but not that of the spoked wheel
- The Harappans did not have weapons
- Ragi or Finger Millets have not been found in any Harappan site in North India
- Shortughai is a Harappan trading post in Afghanistan
